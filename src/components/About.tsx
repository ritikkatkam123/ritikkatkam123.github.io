              Hello! I'm Ritik, a software engineer passionate about creating exceptional 
              digital experiences. My journey in tech began during my undergraduate studies 
              in Information Science and Engineering, and I've since gained over 3 years of 
              experience as a Full-Stack Developer.
            </p> 
            <p className="mb-4">
              Currently, I'm pursuing a Master's in Computer Information Systems at Colorado 
              State University, while also bringing real-world development expertise from my 
              time at Insightsoftware where I've worked on everything from UI migrations to 
              maintaining multi-variant product suites.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              I enjoy solving complex problems through clean code and collaboration. 
              My experience spans across various technologies including React.js, Vue.js, 
              Spring Boot, and database systems. I'm particularly interested in creating 
              intuitive interfaces that enhance user experience while maintining robust 
              functionality.
            </p>
            <p>
              Outside of coding, I'm passionate about AI applications, data visualization, 
              participating in hackathons (pr√üoud winner of one!), and contributing to 
              open-source projects.
